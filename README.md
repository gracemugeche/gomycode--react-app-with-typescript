# âœ… React + TypeScript Conversion Checkpoint

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project was submitted for the **GOMYCODE Checkpoint: Building React Apps with TypeScript**.  
The goal was to convert two simple React components from JavaScript to fully typed TypeScript code, demonstrating understanding of React fundamentals and TypeScript integration.

## ðŸ§  What I Did

- âœ… Converted a **functional component** (`Greeting`) by:
  - Defining a prop type: `name: string`
  - Passing and displaying the name dynamically via props

- âœ… Converted the **Counter component** to a **functional component with hooks**:
  - Defined a props interface for `initialCount`
  - Used `useState` to manage the counter's value
  - Added clean, meaningful comments to explain logic
  - Made the UI and variable names unique from shared code

- âœ… Organized components inside a `components/` folder
- âœ… Used consistent TypeScript typing for props and state
- âœ… Ensured simplicity, readability, and TypeScript correctness

## âœ… Conclusion

This project highlights the ability to build React components using modern TypeScript practices.  
By using functional components and properly typing props and state, the app becomes easier to understand, test, and maintain â€” while keeping the structure clean and scalable.
